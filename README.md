# Implementing-Gradient-for-Regression
Neural networks excellent performance lies in backpropagation algorithm. 
In this walkthrough, you have to define few functions which will give you hands on implementing basic forward pass and backpropagation functions. 
The backpropagation function in this example was implemented for a regression solution, therefore you will note that the output error was multiplied by 1. However, for classification solutions you would need to use weight derivatives instead.
